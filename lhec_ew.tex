\section{Introduction}
Since the discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson at the CERN
LHC experiments and subsequent measurement of its
parameters, all fundamental parameters of the SM have been measured
directly and with remarkable precision.
To further establish the validity of the theory of electroweak
interactions, validate the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking
and the mechanism of the generation of particle masses, further
high-precision electroweak measurements have to be performed.
Such high-precision measurements are also often considered as a portal
to new physics, since non-SM contributions, as for instance
loop-insertions, may yield significant deviations for some precisely
measurable and calculable observables.
The greatly enlarged kinematic reach to higher scales in comparison to
HERA and the large targeted luminosity will allow for the first time
high-precision electroweak measurements in $ep$.

The LHeC experimental conditions offer the opportunity for unique measurements of electroweak
parameters, which are often complementary to other experiments, such
as proton-proton or electron-positron collider experiments or low
energy neutrino or muon scattering experiments.
Among many other quantities, unique measurements of the weak couplings
of the light quarks, $u$ and $d$, can be performed due to the
important contributions of valence quarks in the initial state, as well as scale
dependent measurements of weak interactions, since deep-inelastic $ep$
scattering is mediated through space-like momentum transfer
($t$-channel exchange).

%
In this article we study the sensitivity of inclusive NC and CC cross
section at LHeC to electroweak parameters.

\section{Theory of electroweak effects in inclusive NC and CC DIS cross sections}
%
Inclusive NC DIS cross sections are expressed in terms of
generalised structure functions $\tilde{F}_2^\pm$, $x\tilde{F}_3^\pm$
and $\tilde{F}_{\rm L}^\pm$ at EW leading order (LO)
as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^2\sigma^{\rm NC}(e^\pm p)}{dxd\Qsq} = \frac{2\pi\alpha^2}{xQ^4}\left[Y_+\tilde{F}_2^\pm(x,\Qsq) \mp Y_{-}  x\tilde{F}_3^\pm(x,\Qsq) - y^2 \tilde{F}_{\rm L}^\pm(x,\Qsq)\right]~,
  \label{eq:cs}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ denotes the fine structure constant and $x$ the
Bjorken scaling variable.
The terms $Y_\pm = 1\pm(1-y)^2$ contain the helicity dependence of
the process, where $y$ denotes the inelasticity of the process.
The  generalised structure functions are then separated into contributions
from pure $\gamma$- and $Z$-exchange and their interference~\cite{Klein:1983vs}:
\begin{align}
  \tilde{F}_2^\pm
  &= F_2
  -(\ve\pm P_e\gae)\varkappa_ZF_2^{\gamma Z}
  +\left[(\ve\ve+\gae\gae)\pm2P_e\ve\gae\right]\varkappa_Z^2F_2^Z~,
  \\
  \tilde{F}_3^\pm
  &=~~
  -(\gae\pm P_e\ve)\varkappa_ZF_3^{\gamma Z}
  +\left[2\ve\gae\pm P_e(\ve\ve+\gae\gae)\right]\varkappa_Z^2F_3^Z~.
  \label{eq:strfun}
\end{align}
Similar expressions hold for $\tilde{F}_L$.
%
In the naive quark-parton model, which corresponds to the LO QCD
approximation, the structure functions are calculated as
\begin{align}
  \left[F_2,F_2^{\gamma Z},F_2^Z\right]
  &= x\sum_q\left[Q_q^2,2Q_q\vq,\vq\vq+\aq\aq \right]\{q+\bar{q}\}~,
  \label{eq:last1}
  \\
  x\left[F_3^{\gamma Z},F_3^Z\right]
  &= x\sum_q\left[2Q_q\aq,2\vq\aq\right]\{q-\bar{q}\}~,
  \label{eq:last2}
\end{align}
and it is easily recognized that those are closely related
to the quark and anti-quark momentum distributions, $xq$ and $x\bar{q}$.
In eqs.~\eqref{eq:strfun} and~\eqref{eq:gV-LO}, the variables $g_V^{e/q}$
and $g_A^{e/q}$ stand for the vector and axial-vector couplings of the
lepton or quarks to the $Z$ boson, and the coefficient $\varkappa_Z$
accounts for the $Z$-boson propagator and the normalisation of the  weak contributions.
%
Both parameters are given by electroweak theory.
The (effective) coupling parameters
depend on the electric charge, $Q_{q/e}$, in units of the positron charge,
and on the third component of the weak-isospin of the fermion, $I^3_{{\rm L},q/e}$.
Using $\sw=1-\tfrac{M_W^2}{M_Z^2}$, they are given by
\begin{align}
  g_A^{f} &= \sqrt{\rho_{\text{NC}, f}} I^3_{{\rm L},f}
  \label{eq:gA-LO} \,, \\
  g_V^{f} &= \sqrt{\rho_{\text{NC}, f}} \left(I^3_{{\rm L},f} - 2
  Q_{f} \kappa_{\text{NC}, f}\ \sw \right)
  \label{eq:gV-LO} \,.
\end{align}
The form factors $\rho_{\text{NC}, f}$ and $\kappa_{\text{NC}, f}$
represent the universal higher-order corrections, and due to their
\Qsq\ dependence the couplings become `effective'.
%The latter has been measured with highest precision
%in muon-decay experiments~\cite{Tishchenko:2012ie}.
%
The coefficient $\varkappa_Z$ is calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \varkappa_Z(\Qsq)
  = \frac{\Qsq}{\Qsq+M^2_Z}
  \frac{1}{4\sw \cos^2\theta_W}
  = \frac{\Qsq}{\Qsq+M^2_Z}
  \frac{\gf M_Z^2}{2\sqrt{2}\pi\alpha}~,
\end{equation}
%i.e.\ taking into account either the weak mixing angle, $\sw=1-\mW^2 /
i.e.\ taking into account $\sw$, or alternatively using the Fermi coupling constant $\gf$.

In order to perform predictions in LO electroweak theory only two independent
parameters are needed in addition to $\alpha$.
At higher orders, loop corrections involve a non-negligible dependence
on further parameters, where the most important ones are $M_t$
and $M_H$ and hadronic contributions.


In the LO approximation, the CC DIS cross section is written as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^2\sigma^{\rm CC}(e^\pm p)}{dxd\Qsq}
  = \left(1 \pm P_e\right)
  \frac{\gf^2}{4\pi x}
  \left[\frac{m_W^2}{m_W^2+\Qsq}\right]^2
  \left(Y_+ W_2^\pm(x,\Qsq) \mp Y_{-} xW_3^\pm(x,\Qsq)
  - y^2 W_{\rm L}^\pm(x,\Qsq)\right)~.
  \label{eq:cc-cs}
\end{equation}
In the simplified quark-parton model the structure
functions $W_2^\pm$ and $xW_3^\pm$ are obtained from the parton
distribution functions, while $W_{\rm L}^\pm = 0$:
An incoming electron can scatter only with
positively charged quarks,
\begin{equation}
  W_2^- =
  x \left( U + \overline{D} \right)
  \, ,
  \quad xW_3^- =
  x \left( U - \overline{D} \right)
  \, ,
  \label{eq:w23el-LO}
\end{equation}
while positrons scatter only with negatively charged quarks,
\begin{equation}
  W_2^+ =
  x \left( \overline{U} + D \right)
  \, {~~\text{and}~~}
  \quad xW_3^+ =
  x \left( D - \overline{U} \right)
  \, ,
  \label{eq:w23po-LO}
\end{equation}
using the parton combinations
$U = u+c$, $\overline{U} = \bar{u} + \bar{c}$, $D = d+s$
and $\overline{D} = \bar{d} + \bar{s}$.
{\color{green} Introduce \Qsq dependent form factors.}

Due to renormalisation of the corrections and the choice of
input parameters the calculations become scheme dependent.
In this study we adopt the on-shell scheme using \mz\ and \mw\ as input
parameters to the calculations.

\section{Methdology}
\subsection{The inclusive NC and CC DIS cross section and LHeC}
The single-differential inclusive NC and CC DIS cross sections
for polarised $e^-p$ scattering as function of \Qsq for LHeC electron
and proton beam energies are displayed in
figure~\ref{fig:dSigma}, and compared to measurements at HERA.

  \label{fig:dSigma}
\end{figure}
%
The targeted longitudional polarisation states of the LHeC electron
beam of $P_e=\pm0.8$ will considerably alter the CC DIS cross section,
as it scales linearly with $P_e$, but also for NC cross sections the
polarisation effects are significant in kinematic regions, where
$\gamma Z$ and pure $Z$  exchange are important.
With a reduced electron beam energy of $E_e=50\,\GeV$, the
center-of-mass energy reduces to $1.18\,\TeV$ and
in the exemplary range from $10000<\Qsq<100000\,\GeVsq$
the reduced NC or CC cross sections are lower by about 10 to 15.
With even higher \Qsq\ values, the difference further increases and also the
sensitivity to electroweak parameters in NC exchange reduces
accordingly.

%   Methodology
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Methodology of a combined EW and QCD fit}
{\color{red} DB. This entire section needs to be re-written!}
{\color{green}
The cross section and also all other parameters are predictions within the EW
formalism and can be used to test the validity of the electroweak
theory.}
Reasonable examples are determinations of (all) the weak neutral current
couplings, $g_A^{f}$ and $g_V^{f}$ with $f=(e,u,d,s,c,b,t)$,
or more general, directly the $\rho_{\text{NC}, f}$ and
$\kappa_{\text{NC}, f}$ parameters.
These can be done either in the scale-indpendent LO approximation, by
taking the scale-dependent loop corrections from theory, or their
effective values can be determined at different scales.
More commonly though, the effective weak mixing
angle $\sin\theta_{\text{W}}^{\text{eff},f}:=\kappa_{\text{NC}, q/e}\ \sw$
is tested at different scales, while also this quantity has an
important scheme dependent component (see Ref.~\ref{pdg18} for a
concise dicsussion).
Noteworthy, most of the precision measurements are performed in the
time-like domain, i.e.\ for $\mu^2>0$, whereas DIS is mediated by space-like
momentum transfer, $\Qsq=-q^2$, and thus $q^2<0$.
In DIS at the LHeC, in addition, a large kinematic range can be tested.

Complementary, the measurement of the weak boson masses yields an interesting testing
case of the theory, in particular the measurement of \mw.
This is because \mw\ can be considered as input parameter to the
formalism, or alternatively, if the precision measurement of \gf\ is
been taken as input~\cite{Tishchenko:2012ie}, then \mw becomes a
prediction and can be confronted with the measurement directly.

The expected uncertainties of the electroweak parameters are
obtained in a combined fit of electroweak parameters and the PDFs, where
the inclusive NC and CC DIS pseudo-data (see sect.~\ref{sec:DISdata})
are taken as data and full set of statistical and systematic
uncertainties are considered.
By fitting the PDFs together with EW parameters, uncertainties from the PDFs are taken into
account, which is very reasonable, since the PDFs will predominantly
be determined from those LHeC data in the future.
The details of the PDF fit are altogether fairly similar to the PDF
fits outlined in sect.~\ref{sec:PDFs}, but additionally EW effects are
included into the calculation by considering the full set of 1-loop
electroweak corrections~\cite{todo}.
The pQCD predictions are performed in the zero-mass VFN-scheme
and the $\chi^2$ quantity which is input to the minimisation and
error propagation is based on normal-distributed relative
uncertainties, such avoiding a dependence on the actual size of the
cross sections.

\section{Mass determinations}
\subsection{Weak boson masses ${M_W}$ and $M_Z$}
\label{sec:mass}
The expected uncertainties for a determination of the weak boson masses, \mW\ and \mZ, are determined in the
PDF+EW-fit, where one of the masses is determined
together with the PDFs, while the other mass parameter as taken as external input.
The expected uncertainties of \mW\ are
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \Delta\mW(\text{LHeC-60})&=\pm5_{({\rm exp})}\pm8_{({\rm PDF})}\,\MeV  =\,&& 10_{\text{(tot)}}\,\MeV{\rm ~~and~~} \\
  \Delta\mW(\text{LHeC-50})&=\pm8_{({\rm exp})}\pm9_{({\rm PDF})}\,\MeV  =\,&& 12_{\text{(tot)}}\,\MeV
\nonumber
\end{alignat}
for LHeC with $E_e=60\,\GeV$ or 50\,\GeV, respectively.
The breakdown into experimental and PDF uncertainties is obtained by repeating the fit with PDF
parameters fixed.

These uncertainties are displayed in
figure~\ref{fig:mWZ} and compared to the values obtained by LEP2~\cite{Schael:2013ita},
Tevatron~\cite{Group:2012gb}, ATLAS~\cite{Aaboud:2017svj} and the PDG
value~\cite{PDG}.
The LHeC measurement will become the most precise measurement of a
single experiment and will greatly improve over the best measurement achieved
by H1 of $\mW(\text{H1})=80.520\pm0.115\,\GeV$~\cite{Spiesberger:2018vki}.

In case, the dominating uncorrelated uncertainties can be reduced from
the prospected $0.5\,\%$ to $0.25\,\%$\footnote{Due to performance
  reasons, the pseudo-data are generated for a rather coarse bin grid. With a
  binning, which is closely related to the resolution of the LHeC
  detector, a much finer binning in $x$ and \Qsq are feasible. Already
  such a change would alter the uncertainties of the fit parameters.
  However, such an effect can be reflected by a
  changed uncorrelated uncertainty, and a value of 0.25\,\% appears
  like an optimistic, but achievable,  alternative scenario. },
a precision of \mW\ of up to
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \Delta\mW(\text{LHeC-60})&=\pm3_{({\rm exp})}\pm5_{({\rm PDF})}\,\MeV =\,&& 6_{\text{(tot)}}\,\MeV{\rm ~~and~~} \\
  \Delta\mW(\text{LHeC-50})&=\pm6_{({\rm exp})}\pm6_{({\rm PDF})}\,\MeV =\,&& 8_{\text{(tot)}}\,\MeV
\nonumber
\end{alignat}
for LHeC-60 and LHeC-50 will be achieved, respectively.
A complete dependence of the expected total experimental uncertainty $\Delta\mW$ on the size of the uncorrelated
uncertainty component %, and the normalisation uncertainty
is displayed in
figure~\ref{fig:mWZ}.%, and with more optimistic scenario an uncertainty of up
%to $\Delta\mW\approx5\,\MeV$ can be achieved.
Given such a high experimental precision further theoretical uncertainties
will have to be considered and for instance the uncertainty of the
top-quark mass of $0.5\,\GeV$ will yield an additional uncertainty of $\Delta\mW=2.5\,\MeV$.
The prospected measurement of the $W$-boson mass with LHeC data will be among the most
precise measurements and will significantly improve the world average
value of \mw, which is currently dominated by the ATLAS measurement~\cite{Aaboud:2017svj}.

While the measurement of \mW\ are competitive with other
measurements, the expected experimental uncertainties of \mZ\ are about 11\,MeV and 13\,MeV for
LHeC-60 and LHeC-50, respectively and are thus of similar size than those of \mW.
Therefore, the precision of \mZ\ cannot compete
with the precise measurements at the $Z$-pole by LEP+SLD and future
$e^+e^-$ colliders may even improve on that~\cite{todo,FCCee,ILC}.

A simultaneous determination of \mW\ and \mZ\ is displayed in
fig.~\ref{fig:mWmZ}.
Although the precision of these two mass parameters is only moderate, a
meaningful test of the high-energy behaviour of electroweak theory is
obtained by using additionally the precise measurement of $G_F$ as
additional input:
The high precision of the $G_F$ measurement yields a very shallow
error ellipse and a precise test of the SM can be performed with only
NC and CC DIS cross sections alone.
Such a fit simultaneously determines and tests the
high-energy behaviour of electroweak theory, while taking only low-energy parameters
$\alpha$ and $G_F$ as inputs.
Further parameters like $M_t$ and $M_H$ are needed only for the subleading corrections.

\end{figure}

{\color{magenta}Dicsussion about scheme dependence of parameters?}


\subsection{Further mass determinations}
The inclusive DIS data are sensitive to the top-quark mass $M_t$
through radiative corrections and the $M_t$ dependent terms are the
dominant corrections to the vertex and to the propagator self-energies.
They are considered in the $\rho$ and $\kappa$ parameters and in the
correction factor $\Delta r$, and the leading contributions are
proportional to $M_t^2$. %$\gf{M_t^2}$.
This allows for an indirect determination of the top-quark mass using
LHeC inclusive DIS data, and a determination of $M_t$ will yield an
uncertainty of $\Delta M_t = 1.8\,\GeV$ to 2.2\,\GeV.
Assuming an uncorrelated uncertainty of the DIS pseudo-data of
$0.25\,\%$ the uncertainty of $M_t$ becomes as small as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta M_t=1.1 \text{~~to~~} 1.4\,\GeV
\end{equation}
for 60 and 50\,\GeV electron beams, respectively.
This would
%greatly improve over the limited precision obtained with the final H1
%data~\cite{Spiesberger:2018vki}, and would
represent a very precise
indirect determination of the top-quark mass from purely electroweak
corrections and thus being fully complementary to measurements
from real $t$-quark production, which suffer often from sizeable QCD corrections.
\begin{figure}[tbhp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.42\textwidth]{plot_lhec_mWmt}
    \caption{
      Simultaneous determination of the $W$-boson and $Z$-boson masses
      from LHeC-60 or LHeC-50 data in comparision with the LEP+SLD
      combination and results from a global EW fit~\cite{Haller:2018nnx}.
    }
    \label{fig:mWmt}
\end{figure}

More generally, and to some extent dependent on the choice of the
renormalisation scheme, the leading self-energy and vertex corrections
are proportional to $\tfrac{M_t^2}{\mw^2}$ and thus a simultaneous
determination of $M_t$ and \mw\ is feasible.
The prospects for such a simultaneous determination of $M_t$ and \mw is
displayed in figure~\ref{fig:mWmt}.
It is remarkable, that the precision of the LHeC is
superior than the LEP combination~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab}, which combines results from all of the
four LEP experiments and the SLD experiment, and in an optimistic
scenario with $E_e=60\,\GeV$ and an uncorrelated uncertainty of
$0.25\,\%$ an uncertainty similar to the global electroweak
fit~\cite{Haller:2018nnx} can be achieved.
In a fit without PDF parameters similar uncertainties are found (not shown),
which illustrates that the determination of EW parameters is
to a large extent independent on the QCD phenomenology and the PDFs.

The subleading contributions to the vertex and self-energy corrections
have a Higgs-boson mass dependence and are proportional to
$\log\tfrac{M^2_H}{\mw^2}$.
When fixing all other EW parameters the Higgs boson mass could be
constrained indirectly through these loop corrections
with a precision of $\Delta m_H=^{+29}_{-23}$ to $^{+24}_{-20}\,\GeV$
for different LHeC scenarios.

\Qsq\ dependent higher-order corrections are calculated strictly in
the SM formalism in the 1-loop approximation.

The two-dimensional uncertainty contours at the
68\,\% confidence level obtained with LHeC with $E_e=50\,\GeV$ are
displayed in figure~\ref{fig:couplings} for the two quark families and
compared to recent measurements.
While the current determinations from $e^+e^-$, $ep$ or $p\bar{p}$
data have all somewhat similar precision,
the future LHeC data will greatly improve the
precision of the weak neutral-current couplings and
expected uncertainties are an order of magnitude smaller than the
currently most precise ones~\cite{PDG}.
An electron beam energy of $E_e=60\,\GeV$ or reduced
experimental uncertainties will of course further improve this
measurement.
Alternatively, these coupling parameters can be determined in a
simplified procedure, where only one or two coupling parameters are
determined simultaneously.
Such a procedure yields even higher precision and the prospected
uncertainties are collected in table~\ref{tab:couplings2}

\section{Determination of the $\rho$ and $\kappa$ parameters}
Beyond the born approximation the weak couplings are
subject to higher-order loop corrections.
These corrections are commonly parameterised into the
$\rho_\text{NC}$, $\kappa_\text{NC}$ and $\rho_\text{CC}$
form factors and
many extensions of the Standard Model predict modifications of these
factors, thus making them precision observables.


\subsection{Anomalous NC form factors} % 'anomalous modifications of the NC form factor'?
In NC interactions universal higher-order corrections to the vector
and axial-vector couplings are be taken into account by $\Qsq$
dependent form factors $\rho_{\text{NC}}$ and $\kappa_{\text{NC}}$.
%
Subsequently, commonly the so-called effective weak mixing
angle at the $Z$-pole,
$\sin\theta_{\text{W}}^{\text{eff},q/f}:=\kappa_{\text{NC}, q/f}\ \sw$
is studied with real data, since it is well accessible in asymmetry
measurements in $e^+e^-$ collisions.
%
In inclusive DIS, however, this parameter can be determined only
together with the $\rho$ parameter due to the \Qsq\ dependence and the
presence of the photon exchange terms.

Many of the extensions of the SM predict modifications of the weak
neutral-current couplings and thus modifications of the
$\rho_{\text{NC}}$ and $\kappa_{\text{NC}}$.
Such modifications can be described conveniently by introducing the anomalous parameters \rhop\ and \kapp{},
which can be also considered to be \Qsq\ dependent:
\begin{align}
  g_A^f &= \sqrt{\rho_{\text{NC}, f}\rhop{,f}} \Itf
  \label{eq:gA} \, ,
  \\
  g_V^f &= \sqrt{\rho_{\text{NC}, f}\rhop{,f}} \left( \Itf - 2 Q_f \kappa_{\text{NC}, f}\kapp{,f}\sw \right)
  \label{eq:gV} \,.
\end{align}
Consequently, the estimated relative uncertainties of these parameters
can be interpreted as the relative uncertainty of a
direct determination of $\rho_{\rm NC}$ or $\sin^2\theta_w^{\rm eff}$.
In the following, we compare the uncertainties from LHeC pseudo-data
with the relative uncertainties of
$\sin\theta_{\text{W}}^{\text{eff}}$ and the $\rho_\text{NC}$
parameter from the LEP+SLD combination~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab}, while
setting their actual value to the SM expectation, since we are only
interested in the sensitivity to those parameters at the moment.



First, the uncertainties the anomalous form factors $\rho_\text{NC}^\prime$
and $\kappa_\text{NC}^\prime$ is obtained in a fit together with the PDFs and is
displayed in fig.~\ref{fig:rhokappa} (left).
The results are compared with results of the LEP+SLD combinations and
found to have a similar uncertainty of about a few permille.

    compared with the achieved uncertainties from the LEP+SLD
    combination~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab} for the determination the
    respective factors for leptons.
    Right: uncertainties for the simultaneous determination of the
    anomalous form factors for $u$ and $d$-type quarks, assuming known
    values for the electron parameters.
    The values are compared with uncertainties reported by LEP+SLD for

    $\sin\theta_{\text{W}}^{\text{eff},(c,b)}$ for charm or bottom quarks,
    respectively.
  }
  \label{fig:rhokappa}
\end{figure}



Secondly, when assuming the weak couplings of the electron to be given by the SM formalism,
the anomalous form factors for the two quark families can be
determined, see fig.~\ref{fig:rhokappa} (right).
This is done in a fit of the four parameters
and thus the results can be translated to the results of the coupling
fits (see tab.~\ref{tab:couplings} and fig.~\ref{fig:couplings}).
In fig.~\ref{fig:rhokappa} the uncertainties for three different LHeC
scenarios are compared with uncertainties from the LEP+SLD
combination~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab}.
Since in the LEP+SLD analysis the values of $\rho$ and $\kappa\sw$
are determined themselves, we compare only the size of the uncertainties.
Furthermore it shall be noted, that LEP is mainly sensitive to the
parameters of leptons or heavy quarks, while LHeC data is more
sensitive to light quarks ($u$,$d$,$s$), and thus the LHeC
measurements are highly complementary.

      $0.25\,\%$ on the data points is imposed.
  }
  \label{fig:rhokappaQ2}
\end{figure}
A meaningful test of the SM is obtained by determining the scale
dependence of the anomalous form factors.
In case of the $\kappa_\text{NC}^\prime$ parameter this procedure is equivalent to the
running of the effective weak mixing angle,
$\sin\theta_{\text{W}}^{\text{eff}}(\mu)$.
However, DIS is again complementary to other measurements since the
process is mediated in the space-like regime, i.e.\ $\Qsq=-q^2$ with
$q$ being the boson four-momentum.
Prospects for a determination of $\rho_\text{NC}^\prime$ or $\kappa_\text{NC}^\prime$ at
different \Qsq\ values is displayed in fig.~\ref{fig:rhokappaQ2} and
compared to results obtaind by H1.
The value of $\kappa_\text{NC}^\prime(\mu)$ can be easily translated to a
measurement of the effective weak mixing angle and shows, that this
quantity can be determind with a precision of up to 0.1\,\% and with
bettern than at least 1\,\% over a wide kinematic range of about
$25<\sqrt{\Qsq}<700\,\GeV$.



%% EW in CC
\subsection{Electroweak effects in charged-current exchange}
At the LHeC, the charged current sector can be uniquely measured
over many orders of magnitude in $Q^2$, due to the excellent tracking
detectors, calorimetry, and high-bandwidth triggers.
%
%This provides a precise determination of the $W$-boson mass (see
%above)
%and furthermore, the form factors of the
%effective couplings of the fermions to the $W$-boson can be uniquely
%measured.
%
Similarly as in the NC case, higher-order EW corrections to the CC
cross sections are collected in the effective couplings of the
fermions to the $W$-boson and these are represented in terms of the
form factors $\rho_{\text{CC},eq}$ and $\rho_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}$.
%
In the SM formalism, only two of these form factors are present.
Since extensions of the SM formalism likely alter these factors, we
introduce two anomalous form factors
$\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},(eq/e\bar{q})}$,
whose values are unity for the strict validity of the SM and
%$\rho_{\text{CC},(eq/e\bar{q})} \rightarrow \rho^\prime_{\text{CC},(eq/e\bar{q})} \rho_{\text{CC},(eq/e\bar{q})}$.
the CC structure functions then become 
\begin{align}
  W_2^- &=
  x \left( (\rho_{\text{CC}, eq}\rhopW{,eq})^2 U + (\rho_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}\rhopW{,e\bar{q}})^2 \overline{D} \right)
  \, ,
  \\
  xW_3^- &=
  x \left( (\rho_{\text{CC},eq}\rhopW{,eq})^2 U - (\rho_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}\rhopW{,e\bar{q}})^2 \overline{D} \right)
  \, ,
\\
  W_2^+ &=
  x \left( (\rho_{\text{CC},eq}\rhopW{,eq})^2 \overline{U}+ (\rho_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}\rhopW{,e\bar{q}})^2 D \right)
  \, ,
  \\
  xW_3^+ &=
  x \left( (\rho_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}\rhopW{,e\bar{q}})^2 D - (\rho_{\text{CC},eq}\rhopW{,eq})^2 \overline{U} \right)
  \, .
\end{align}



\begin{figure}[thbp]
    \centering

    $\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},eq}$ and $\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}$ for
    different LHeC scenarios in comparison with the H1
    measurement~\cite{Spiesberger:2018vki}.
    Right: scale dependent measurement of the anomalous modification
    of the charged current form factor $\rho^\prime_{\text{CC}}(\Qsq)$, assuming $\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},eq}=\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}=\rho^\prime_{\text{CC}}$.
  }
  \label{fig:rhoCC}
\end{figure}
The prospects for a determination of these anomalous form factors with
LHeC data are obtained by performing a fit of the two parameters
$\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},eq}$ and $\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}$ together with
the PDFs.
This procedure is equivalent to a direct determination of the the
factors $\rho_{\text{CC},eq}$ and $\rho_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}$
themselves and results are displayed in fig.~\ref{fig:rhoCC} and
collected in table~\ref{tab:rhoCC}.
It is found, that these parameter can be determined with a relative
uncertainty of up to 0.2--0.3\,\%.
This represents a unique measurement at very high precision of charged
current interactions at considerably high scales.


Furthermore, the \Qsq dependence of the anomalous form factors can be studied.
Relative uncertainties obtained in a determination of
$\rho^\prime_\text{CC}$ at various values of \Qsq, where we used
$\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},eq}=\rho^\prime_{\text{CC},e\bar{q}}$ and
in that fit all parameters at the various \Qsq values are fitted
simultaneously and together with the PDFs, are displayed in fig.~\ref{fig:rhoCC}.
It is found, that with the LHeC data the potential deviation of
$\rho^\prime_\text{CC}$ from
the SM expectation can be studied with very high precision and over a
large range in $\sqrt{\Qsq}$, up to values of $\sqrt{\Qsq}$ of about 500\,\GeV.
